This Repository Consists of all the tasks that were assigned to me during internship at Oasis Infobyte as a Data Science Intern from June 10th 2024 to July 10th 2024

## Task1 : IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements.
In this task, I performed a detailed analysis and classification of the Iris flower dataset using various machine learning models.

## Task2 : CAR PRICE PREDICTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING
In this task, I developed a machine learning model to predict car prices based on various features such as like the goodwill of the brand of the car, features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives , model, year, and many more. 
The goal of this project was to build an accurate and reliable model that can help potential car buyers or sellers estimate the value of a car given its attributes.

## Task3 : SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON
Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product.
Here, the machine learning model is used to predict the sales of advertising media items like tv, radio, and newspaper. And the model uses a Multiple Linear Regression Algorithm to predict the sales of items on a scale.
